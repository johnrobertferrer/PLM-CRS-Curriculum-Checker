# PLM CRS: Curriculum Checker

The PLM CRS Module: Curriculum Checker is an additional feature created for the official PLM CRS. The system aims to help in generating the list of graduating students in the university. It filters and analyzes the records of students and tags them whether they are graduating or not. Students can also keep track of their records via looking at their checklist provided in the system.
